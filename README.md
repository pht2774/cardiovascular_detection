User Guide
	We provided a Jupyter notebook (CVD_ML_ptran.ipynb) that can be run on Google Colab for data analysis, ML model training and exporting. We also included app.py for end-user to test run the web application. Everything is included in the ml_app folder. Please refer to the detailed guide below to install and run the application.

2.	Open terminal windows and navigate to the ml_app directory
3.	Run the following command ‘source .venv/bin/activate’ to activate the included virtual environment.
4.	Then run ‘python3 app.py’ to start the Flask app server (depending on how Python is configured on the user computer, use ‘python’ instead of ‘python3’ if applicable).
